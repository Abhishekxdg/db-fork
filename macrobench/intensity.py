"""Workload intensity multipliers.

``Workload.branch_intensity`` and ``Workload.data_intensity`` are applied
once, before the run starts, by :func:`apply_intensity`. They multiply the
explicit knobs in place so the scenarios never see them and the e2e stats
record the effective values.

branch_intensity scales the number of branch verbs a scenario issues:

* ``branch_ops.commit_interval`` is divided (more commits per step).
* Scenario counts of branches, forks, rounds, rebases, investigation
  points and S6's resets per batch (``BRANCH_FIELDS``). S2's rejections follow from its cycles
  (one per ``cycles_per_rejection`` cycles) and S5's incidents from its
  spine commits (one per ``commits_per_incident``), so they scale too.

data_intensity scales how much SQL runs on each branch:

* ``data_ops.statements_per_step``, ``rows_per_write`` and ``spine_clients``.
* Scenario per-branch step and row counts (``DATA_FIELDS``).

Threads (``worker_threads``, ``concurrent_*``), probabilities, fractions and
caps such as ``max_live_branches`` are left alone, because they bound the
run rather than size it. Scaled ints are rounded and never drop below 1;
a few fields have hard caps the scenarios enforce (S2 fanout <= 10, S4
rebases_per_branch <= 2, S1 group_size <= 32 with rollouts_per_round <= group_size)
and S5 keeps ``fault_commit_offset`` inside
``spine_commits``.
